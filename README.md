üöÄ Key Features & Technologies Used :

This project showcases proficiency in a wide array of essential Excel tools and data analysis concepts:

‚Ä¢	Data Extraction & Transformation (ETL):
o	Power Query Editor: Utilized for efficient data loading from a folder (handling multiple CSVs), robust data cleaning (e.g., handling data types, removing irrelevant columns), and complex data transformations (e.g., extracting date/time components, calculating delivery durations).

‚Ä¢	Data Modeling:
o	Power Pivot: Employed to build a robust Star Schema data model, establishing one-to-many relationships between Fact (Orders) and Dimension (Customers, Products) tables.

‚Ä¢	Advanced Calculations:
o	DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Used to create calculated columns (e.g., Revenue, Day Name) within the Power Pivot data model for enhanced analytical capabilities.

‚Ä¢	Data Analysis & Visualization:
o	Pivot Tables: Generated dynamic summaries to answer specific business questions.
o	Pivot Charts: Created various chart types (Bar, Line) for compelling visual representation of trends and comparisons.
o	Slicers: Implemented interactive filters for dynamic exploration of data by Occasion.
o	Timelines: Added interactive date filters for granular analysis across time periods.

‚Ä¢	Statistical Analysis:
o	CORREL Function: Applied to assess the relationship between Order Quantity and Delivery Time.
‚Ä¢	Dashboard Design:
o	Created a user-friendly, interactive dashboard integrating KPIs, charts, and filters for a holistic view of sales performance.

üìÇ Dataset Overview
The analysis is based on three interconnected CSV files, representing key aspects of Ferns N Petals' operations:
‚Ä¢	customers.csv: Contains customer demographics (Customer ID, Name, City, Gender, Contact, Email, Address).
‚Ä¢	orders.csv: The central Fact Table, detailing each order (Order ID, Customer ID, Product ID, Quantity, Order Date/Time, Delivery Date/Time, Location, Occasion).
‚Ä¢	products.csv: Provides product details (Product ID, Product Name, Category, Price, Occasion, Description).

4.	Top Products by Revenue: Identify the highest-earning products.
5.	Customer Spending Analysis: Understand the average order value per customer.
6.	Sales Performance by Top Categories: Analyze revenue contribution from different product categories.
7.	Top 10 Cities by Number of Orders: Pinpoint cities with the highest order volumes.
8.	Order Quantity vs. Delivery Time: Analyze if higher order quantities impact delivery times using correlation.
9.	Revenue Comparison by Occasions: Compare revenue generated across various gifting occasions.
10.	Product Popularity by Occasion: Identify which products are most popular during specific occasions.
11.	Order Patterns by Hour/Day: Analyze preferred ordering times/days for targeted marketing.

üõ†Ô∏è Methodology & Project Phases
The project followed a structured data analysis pipeline:
1.	Data Extraction:
o	Utilized Power Query Editor's "From Folder" feature to import all three CSV files simultaneously, ensuring future scalability for new data.
2.	Data Cleaning & Transformation:
o	products: Removed irrelevant 'Description' column.
o	customers: Converted 'Contact Number' to 'Text' to preserve formatting.
o	orders:
ÔÇß	Extracted Month Name, Order Hour, and Delivery Hour from date/time columns using "Add Column" in Power Query.
ÔÇß	Calculated Delivery Difference (Days) by subtracting Order Date from Delivery Date.
ÔÇß	Performed a Left Outer Merge (Join) with the products table on Product ID to bring Price into the orders table, essential for revenue calculation.
ÔÇß	Ensured correct data types across all columns.
3.	Data Loading:
o	Loaded the transformed data from Power Query directly into Excel's Data Model, enabling multi-table analysis.
4.	Data Modeling (Power Pivot):
o	Enabled Power Pivot Add-in.
o	In Power Pivot Diagram View, established One-to-Many relationships:
ÔÇß	Customers[Customer ID] ‚û°Ô∏è Orders[Customer ID]
ÔÇß	Products[Product ID] ‚û°Ô∏è Orders[Product ID]
o	This created a Star Schema, optimizing for efficient querying.
5.	Advanced Calculations (DAX):
o	Created a Revenue calculated column in the Orders table: Revenue = [Quantity] * [Price].
o	Created a Day Name calculated column in the Orders table: Day Name = FORMAT([Order Date], "DDDD").
6.	Data Analysis (Pivot Tables & Formulas):
o	Generated multiple Pivot Tables from the Data Model to answer each business question.
o	Applied Value Filters (e.g., Top 5, Top 10) and custom sorting (e.g., chronological month order).
o	Used the CORREL function in Excel to statistically analyze the relationship between Order Quantity and Delivery Time, finding a weak positive correlation (0.3478).
7.	Dashboard Creation & Interactivity:
o	Designed a dedicated "Dashboard" sheet.
o	Inserted Pivot Charts (Bar, Line) for each key insight.
o	Integrated Slicers (for Occasion) and Timelines (for Order Date) and connected them to all relevant Pivot Tables using Report Connections for dynamic filtering.
o	Displayed key KPIs (Total Orders, Total Revenue, Average Order-to-Delivery Time, Average Customer Spending) using shapes linked to Pivot Table values.
o	Applied consistent formatting and branding (FNP logo, theme colors) for a professional look.
8.	Executive Summary:
o	Utilized AI (ChatGPT/Gemini) to draft a concise executive summary, highlighting key insights and actionable recommendations derived from the dashboard.

üí° Key Insights & Outcomes
The interactive dashboard provides the following critical insights:
‚Ä¢	Revenue Peaks: Significant revenue spikes observed during major gifting occasions like Rakshabandhan, Anniversary, Diwali, and Holy.
‚Ä¢	Average Delivery: Orders are delivered, on average, within ~5-6 days.
‚Ä¢	Top Performers: Identified top-selling products and categories (e.g., 'Colors' during Holi, 'Sweets' generally) and top contributing cities.
‚Ä¢	Ordering Patterns: Revealed peak ordering times (e.g., 7-8 PM, surprisingly 6 AM), valuable for targeted marketing campaigns.
‚Ä¢	Customer Spending: Average customer spending per order is approximately ‚Çπ3,520.
‚Ä¢	Quantity vs. Delivery: A weak positive correlation suggests that while higher quantities might slightly increase delivery time, it's not a dominant factor.
